## My name's Daniel and I run House of DB, a design studio that is all about making a difference.  Whether creating a new brand identity and logo, or conceptualising packaging design, the same amount of thought, consideration, enthusiasm and determination goes into the process.

## Established in mid 2014, House of DB is a full service graphic design and illustration studio, with a firm belief that it's all about the creative process...and House of DB loves creating.  I like working with clients who want to be hands on, collaborative and eager to be part of the journey but am equally comfortable being given a brief and told to just run with it.  House of DB strives to create work that is bold and unique but more importantly effective and something the client is excited about and proud to use.

## For House of DB, it's about who you are today and where you want to be tomorrow.
